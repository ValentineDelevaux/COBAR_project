# COBAR_project
Implement courtship chasing while keeping a specific distance to the other fly using visual detection of the distance to the other fly

TODO: 
- Implement sideway walking --> change dof, biases etc
- Implement a changing state fly --> according to arousal state
- Implement wings vibrations
- Plot of target vs chasing fly behavior (inspire from papers)
- Start wings vibration/crabe walking when the fly stops for target fly stops for some time

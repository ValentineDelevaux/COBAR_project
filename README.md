## Project overview
The goal of the project is to implement courtship chasing while keeping a specific distance to the other fly using visual detection of the distance between flies.

## Prerequisites
The files contained in `data` must be added to the flygym-v1 repository for the provided code to run:
- `config.yaml` should replace the original config.yaml file contained in `flygym-v1/flygym`
- `neuromechfly_courtship_kinorder_ypr.yml` should be added in `flygym-v1/flygym/data/mjcf`

To run the notebooks, use the flygym-v1 environment, with seaborn installed in addition (use `pip install seaborn`)

## Structure 
This repository contains different folders: 
- `data`: contains the two files to include in the flygym-v1 repository for the code to function 
- `scripts`: contains the definitions of the classes and functions implemented and used for the simulation
- `outputs`: contains the final videos 

The codes running the different simulations are in the notebooks: 
- `1_scenario.ipynb`: run the whole scenario of the courtship behavior
- `2_chasing.ipynb`: run the chasing part
- `3_crab_walk_and_wings_extension.ipynb`: run the crab walking part along with wing extension behavior 
- `4_robustness_visual_processing`: studies the robustness of visual processing with colored terrain and flies
